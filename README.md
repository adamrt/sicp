# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repo contains my journey through the second edition of Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs hardback book and the [MIT
Lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/).

My initial plan is to use a separate laptop that I will install
OpenBSD, Emacs and Racket on it, using a pretty minimal
configuration. This is just to remove distraction while studying.

I will watch the lecture then do that section of the book including
the exercises.
